# Implementation Checkpoints Guide

## Purpose

This document provides detailed in-game testing checkpoints for each phase of Beltalowda development. Each checkpoint ensures that implementation is working correctly before moving to the next phase.

**Philosophy**: Test early, test often, don't move forward with broken code.

---

## Phase 0: Foundation

### Checkpoint 0.1: Libraries Installed

**When**: After adding LibSets and LibAsync

**How to Test**:
1. Launch ESO
2. Log in to any character
3. Open chat console with `/`
4. Run: `/script d(LibSets ~= nil)`
   - Should see: `true`
5. Run: `/script d(LibAsync ~= nil)`
   - Should see: `true`
6. Check for error messages in chat
   - Should see: No errors related to Beltalowda

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ No addon load errors
- ✅ LibSets available
- ✅ LibAsync available
- ✅ All existing features still work

**If Problems**:
- Check `Lib/LibSets/` folder structure
- Check `Lib/LibAsync/` folder structure
- Verify manifest DependsOn line
- Check load order in manifest

**Success Criteria**: All libraries load, no errors, can proceed to module stubs

### Checkpoint 0.1b: Existing Library Research ✅ COMPLETE - REVISED

**When**: After researching LibGroupCombatStats, LibSetDetection, and LibGroupResources

**Research Method**: Web research + analysis of ESOUI documentation, GitHub repos, and community forums

**🎉 MAJOR UPDATE - REVISED** (based on user feedback):
- Original finding: 2 custom protocols needed (Health+Resources, Position)
- **Revised finding: ZERO custom protocols needed for MVP** 🎉

**User Feedback Incorporated** (@Kickimanjaro - Comment #3703725424):
1. ❌ Health tracking NOT needed - game UI already shows it (original assessment was incorrect)
2. ✅ Position tracking - can use LibGPS locally (no group broadcast needed initially)
3. 💡 May not need ANY custom protocols at all - **CONFIRMED** ✅

**Research Tasks Completed**:
1. **LibGroupCombatStats**: ✅
   - Provides: Ultimate Type (ID 20), Ultimate Value (ID 21), DPS (ID 22), HPS (ID 23)
   - Used by: Hodor Reflexes (battle-tested in production)
   - Coverage: 100% of ultimate tracking needs
   - **Decision: ADOPT** ✅

2. **LibSetDetection**: ✅
   - Provides: Equipped set pieces (ID 40) for all 14 equipment slots
   - Used by: Currently Equipped, DebuffTracker, YANP
   - Coverage: 100% of equipment tracking needs
   - **Decision: ADOPT** ✅

3. **LibGPS**: ✅ (Already have from Phase 0)
   - Provides: Local position tracking (X, Y coordinates)
   - Coverage: 100% of local position needs
   - **Decision: USE FOR LOCAL FEATURES** ✅
   - No LibGroupBroadcast protocol needed initially

4. **LibGroupResources**: ✅
   - Provides: Magicka (ID 11), Stamina (ID 10)
   - ~~Missing: Health (CRITICAL for PvP)~~
   - **REVISED**: Health NOT needed (user feedback - game UI shows it)
   - Coverage: Partial resource tracking but not valuable alone
   - **Decision: SKIP** ⚠️

5. **LibGroupPotionCooldowns**: ✅
   - Provides: Potion cooldown tracking (ID 26)
   - Coverage: Optional Tier 2 feature
   - **Decision: OPTIONAL** - Add later if needed ⚪

**Decision Matrix - REVISED**:
- ✅ LibGroupCombatStats: **USE** - Covers 100% of ultimate needs
- ✅ LibSetDetection: **USE** - Covers 100% of equipment needs, no conflicts with LibSets
- ✅ LibGPS: **USE** - Covers local position needs (already have)
- ⚠️ LibGroupResources: **DON'T USE** - Not valuable without Health requirement
- ⚪ LibGroupPotionCooldowns: **OPTIONAL** - Add later if potion tracking becomes priority

**Research Findings - REVISED**:
- **Minimum data needed**: **3 critical types** (Ultimate %, Ultimate ID, Equipment) - REVISED from 5
  - ~~Health removed~~ - Game UI already shows it
  - ~~Position demoted~~ - Can use LibGPS locally
- **Library coverage**: **100% of critical needs** (3/3) 🎉 - UP from 60%
- **Custom protocols needed**: **ZERO for MVP** 🎉 - DOWN from 2
- **Efficiency gain**: Reduced from 8 custom protocols → 0 needed (**100% reduction**) 🎉🎉🎉

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ All libraries researched via web search
- ✅ Documentation of capabilities and gaps
- ✅ Decision made on which to integrate
- ✅ Updated LIBGROUPBROADCAST_INTEGRATION.md with findings
- ✅ Created comprehensive research document: `.copilot-responses/CHECKPOINT_0.1b_RESEARCH.md` (original)
- ✅ Created revised research document: `.copilot-responses/CHECKPOINT_0.1b_REVISED.md` (updated) ⭐
- ✅ User feedback incorporated - **NO custom protocols needed!**

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Clear understanding of existing libraries, informed decision on custom vs reuse - **100% library coverage achieved**
