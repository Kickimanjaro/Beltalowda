## Questions Answered

### Q: Understanding LibGroupBroadcast
**Answer**: See LIBGROUPBROADCAST_INTEGRATION.md

**Summary**:
- LibGroupBroadcast is already a dependency in Beltalowda
- Far superior to party chat for data sharing
- Larger payloads (512 bytes vs ~100 chars)
- Reliable delivery with acknowledgment
- Designed for addon data (binary protocol)
- Need to request message ID block (200-219 recommended)
- Already using some IDs (50, 60, 109, 110, 167-170, 188-190)
- No additional dependencies (standalone library)

### Q: Understanding LibSets
**Answer**: See LIBSETS_INTEGRATION.md

**Summary**:
- LibSets provides comprehensive item set data
- Requires LibAsync (download from ESOUI) and LibDebugLogger (already have)
- Enables:
  - Set identification from equipped items
  - Role detection (tank/healer/DPS by gear)
  - Monster set cooldown tracking
  - Set coordination across group
- Integration involves adding to Lib/ folder and updating manifest
- EquipmentCollector module will handle data collection

### Q: Dependent Libraries
**Answer**: See ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md, Dependency Analysis section

**Complete Dependency Tree**:
```
Already Have:
- LibAddonMenu-2.0 (settings)
- LibMapPins, LibMapPing, LibGPS (positioning)
- Lib3D (3D rendering)
- LibFoodDrinkBuff, LibPotionBuff (tracking)
- LibCustomMenu (menus)
- LibGroupBroadcast (data sharing)
- LibDebugLogger (debugging)

Need to Add:
- LibSets (set detection)
- LibAsync (dependency of LibSets)
```

### Q: SavedVariables Usage
**Answer**: See SAVEDVARIABLES_GUIDE.md

**Summary**:
- Two scopes: account-wide and per-character
- Beltalowda uses profile system (account-wide profiles, per-char selection)
- Account-wide: UI positions, tracked ultimates, shared settings
- Per-character: selected ultimate, role, last position
- Enhanced structure adds: data collection settings, ultimate tracking enhancements, synergy tracking, attack coordination, QoL features, broadcasting preferences
- Migrations handle version upgrades
- Always provide defaults to avoid nil errors

### Q: File Structure
**Answer**: See ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md, Core Data Collection Layer section

**Proposed Clean Structure**:
```
Base/Data/              # New: Data collection modules
├── DataCollector.lua
├── ResourceCollector.lua
├── PositionCollector.lua
├── AbilityCollector.lua
├── EquipmentCollector.lua
├── StateCollector.lua
└── PreferencesCollector.lua

Base/Network/           # New: Network layer

```

### Q: Implementation Order / What to Build First
**Answer**: See DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md

**Order Rationale**:
1. **Phase 0: Foundation** - Don't break anything, set up infrastructure
2. **Phase 1: Data Collection** - Collect data locally first (no networking complexity)
3. **Phase 2: LibGroupBroadcast** - Share basic data once collection works
4. **Phases 3-8: Features** - Build features incrementally on data foundation
5. **Phases 9-10: Polish** - Refine once features work
6. **Phase 11: Optimize** - Performance tuning near end
7. **Phase 12: Test & Document** - Final validation

**Why This Order**:
- Data collection first avoids dependency on networking
- Can test locally with debug commands
- Each phase builds on previous
- Regular checkpoints prevent getting "too far ahead"
- Features depend on data layer, so data layer first
- Optimization near end when you know what needs optimizing

### Q: Regular In-Game Checkpoints
**Answer**: See IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKPOINTS.md

**Summary**:
- 30+ detailed checkpoints across all phases
- Each checkpoint is in-game testable with specific commands
- Example checkpoints:
  - Phase 0.1: Verify libraries loaded (`/script d(LibSets ~= nil)`)
  - Phase 1.1: Test resource tracking (`/btlwdata resources`)
  - Phase 2.2: Test 2-player sync (`/btlwdata group`)
  - Phase 8.1: Test bomb timer accuracy (cast proxy det, verify 8s)
- Every checkpoint has:
  - Exact test steps
  - Expected results
  - Troubleshooting if fails
  - Success criteria before proceeding
- Prevents building on broken foundation

## Next Steps for AI Agent Development

### Immediate Actions (Human)
1. Review all planning documents
2. Decide on starting phase (recommend Phase 0)
3. Approve overall approach
4. Request LibGroupBroadcast message IDs if approved

### Phase 0: Foundation (First AI Agent Task)
**Goal**: Set up infrastructure without breaking existing features

**Instructions for AI Agent**:
```
Task: Complete Phase 0 of Beltalowda enhancement

Context:
- Review ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md sections: "Proposed Enhanced Architecture" and "Phase 0"
- Review LIBSETS_INTEGRATION.md section: "Installation Steps"
- Review DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md section: "Phase 0"
- Review IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKPOINTS.md sections: "Checkpoint 0.1" and "Checkpoint 0.2"

Deliverables:
1. Download LibSets and LibAsync, place in Lib/ folder
2. Update Beltalowda.txt manifest with new dependencies
3. Update Beltalowda.lua library check function
4. Create Base/Data/ directory with stub collector modules
5. Create Base/Network/ directory with stub GroupBroadcast.lua
6. All modules initialized with proper namespaces (using 'or {}' pattern)
7. Update Beltalowda.txt to load new files
8. Test using Checkpoint 0.1 and 0.2 procedures

Success Criteria:
- All checkpoints pass
- No existing features broken
- No errors when loading addon

Constraints:
- Follow ESO_ADDON_BEST_PRACTICES.md patterns
- Use namespace 'or {}' pattern everywhere
- Don't implement functionality yet, just structure
- Test after each change
```

### Subsequent Phases
Each phase follows same pattern:
1. Review relevant sections in planning docs
2. Implement according to DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
3. Test using IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKPOINTS.md
4. Only proceed if checkpoints pass

## Key Takeaways

### What Makes This Plan Good

**1. Builds on Existing Foundation**
- Doesn't throw away working RdK code
- Enhances, doesn't replace
- Maintains compatibility

**2. Modular Design**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Data collection separate from features
- Features independent of each other
- Easy to enable/disable features

**3. Incremental Development**
- 26 weeks broken into 12 phases
- Each phase builds on previous
- Regular testing checkpoints
- Can stop/resume at any phase

**4. Comprehensive Planning**
- Architecture documented
- Integration guides for libraries
- SavedVariables structure defined
- Testing procedures detailed
- Risk mitigation planned

**5. User-Focused**
- Settings menu reorganized for clarity
- UI presets for quick setup (tank/healer/DPS)
- Quality of life features enhanced
- Documentation for end users

### Potential Concerns

**1. Scope**
- 26 weeks is ambitious
- Many features to implement
- Mitigation: Phased approach allows early release of core features

**2. Testing**
- Requires multiple players for full testing
- Mitigation: Debug commands for solo testing, recruit testers early

**3. LibGroupBroadcast IDs**
- Need official assignment
- Mitigation: Can use temporary high IDs (200+) while waiting

**4. Performance**
- 12-player groups with lots of data sharing
- Mitigation: Optimization phase (11), throttling, batching

**5. Maintenance**
- Large feature set means more maintenance
- Mitigation: Modular design, good documentation
